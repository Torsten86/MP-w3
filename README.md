i have done all 3 levels.

As i understand the project description we are sorting our table first on Country and then on PurchaseDate.
In my opinion there are some conflicting information between levgel 2 and elvel 3 on that issue.
Level 2 says to sort on Item first and on PurchaseDate second, and level 3 says to sort on Country first and PurchaseDate second

Used a list and user input just like we did in the project for week 2, i also copied the navigation from week 2.

After asking in the group chat i am using dummy values for the currency exchange, and not live values.

For the age check i am using 2 hardcoded entries to the list, you can change the date on them to test my TextColor.
In this check i used 1 year as 365days, and 1 month as 30 days, simply cheking for the age in days, insted of years, months and days.

my calculations for the yellow and red text is ((365*2)+(9*30))=1000 for Red text, and ((365*2)+(6*30))=910 giving me the range of 910-999days for Yellow text.

i started with a hardcoded list to get all the info in the program, and chek my methods for solving most of the problems.
Aftter that was clear i kept 2 hardcoded items, and switched the rest to user inputs, to prevent having to write alot for each printout chek i tried ot minimize the nessesary input.
